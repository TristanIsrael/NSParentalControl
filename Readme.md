# NS Parental Control

NS Parental Control is a simple app that allows parents to set limits on their childrenâ€™s use of the Nintendo Switch console.

*This is a proof-of-concept of an app and was made only for experimenting app development on the Nintendo Switch.* 

It can be used freely.

## Current version

## Build

This section explains how to create and install the binary for NS Parental Control.

### Architecture

This product relies on 3 components:
1 - a sysmodule that monitors the games usage and notifies when limit is reached.
2 - an overlay that shows on demand information about the limits and permits setup of the limits.

The sysmodule and the overlay share a common database file. 

### Pre-requisistes

- Atmosphere installed
- Development computer with `devkitPro` and `devkitA64` (see below)
- `libnx` (Switch homebrew SDK) installed via devkitPto
- Tesla menu installed on the Switch

```
sudo apt install git make cmake build-essential
wget https://apt.devkitpro.org/devkitpro-keyring_20230702_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i devkitpro-keyring_20230702_all.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install devkitpro-dev
sudo apt install devkitarm-dev devkita64-dev
```

### Auto-start Parental Control

- On the SD card, create the folder `/atmosphere/contents/0004000000000000/ParentalControl/` (if 0004000000000000 already exists, choose another one randomly).
- Copy the file `ParentalControl.nro` into the new folder and rename it to `main.nro`.
- Create a new folder `/atmosphere/contents/0004000000000000/ParentalControl/meta/`.
- Copy the file `meta.ini` provided into this folder.
